### Plotly & Cufflinks : 
Data Visulization with plotly might not be directly visible on GitHub as it contains an interactive plots which are similar to the      what we develop on Tableau or PoweBI Dashboards. It can be visible by running all the cells in an IDE. Here, files contains interactive boxplots,scatter plots, histogram and scatter matrix.
                                        
### Geographical Plotting using Plotly (Choropleth Maps) : The same visulization can be viewed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/smit22shah/geographical-mapping-choropleth-maps-plotly/notebook) which might not be fully visible on GitHub.
